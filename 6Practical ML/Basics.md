### Simple linear regression
statistical technique used for finding the existence of an association relaï¿¾tionship between a dependent variable (aka response variable or outcome variable) and an independent 
variable (aka explanatory variable, predictor variable or feature)

### Steps in building a regression model
1. Collect/Extract Data
2. Pre-Process the Data
3. Dividing Data into Training and Validation Datasets
4. Perform Descriptive Analytics or Data Exploration
5. Build the Model
6. Perform Model Diagnostics
7. Validate the Model and Measure Model Accuracy
8. Decide on Model Deployment

### Building simple linear regression model
Assumptions of the Linear Regression Model
Properties of Simple Linear Regression
1. Creating Feature Set (X) and Outcome Variable (Y)
2. Splitting the Dataset into Training and Validation Sets
3. Fitting the Model
	1. Printing Estimated Parameters and Interpreting Them
	2. Complete Code for Building Regression Model

### Model diagnostics
1. Co-efficient of determination (R-squared)
2. Hypothesis test for the regression coefficient.
3. Analysis of variance for overall model validity (important for multiple linear regression).
4. Residual analysis to validate the regression model assumptions
5. Outlier analysis, since the presence of outliers can significantly impact the regression parameters

Regression Model Summary Using Python
Residual Analysis
1. The residuals are normally distributed
2. Variance of residual is constant (homoscedasticity)
3. The functional form of regression is correctly specified
4. There are no outliers

### Multiple Linear Regression
