### Summary of Class Types:

| **Class Type**        | **Description**                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular Classes       | Standard classes with attributes and methods.                             |
| Abstract Base Classes | Classes that cannot be instantiated and define abstract methods.          |
| Data Classes          | Classes designed to store data with minimal boilerplate code.             |
| Immutable Classes     | Classes whose instances cannot be modified after creation.                |
| Singleton Classes     | Classes that allow only one instance to exist.                            |
| Metaclasses           | Classes that define the behavior of other classes.                        |
| Mixins                | Classes that provide reusable functionality through multiple inheritance. |
| Enum Classes          | Classes for defining named constants.                                     |
| Protocol Classes      | Classes for structural subtyping (duck typing).                           |
| Dynamic Classes       | Classes created dynamically at runtime.                                   |
